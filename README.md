# Hello! My name is Karnveer Singh and I am a double major student studying Computer Science and Information Technology at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT)
# My previous work experience comprises of various internships. Most recently I had the opportunity to intern as a Cloud Engineer at a consulting firm in NYC where I worked with management and other interns on the front end, back end, and cloud deployment of a web application for a client of the firm
# I’m currently proficient in Python, Java, C++, HTML & CSS, PHP, SQL, JavaScript, C, C#, and Microsoft Azure and I look forward to continuing on developing my skills and interests!
